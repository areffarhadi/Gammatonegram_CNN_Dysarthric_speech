# Gammatonegram_CNN_Dysarthric_speech
MATLAB implementation for Dysarthric Speech Processing using Gammatonegram and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the UA speech dataset.

the dataset can be downloaded form [UA speech dataset link](http://www.isle.illinois.edu/sst/data/UASpeech/).
using this package you can use [a pretrained CNN net](https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ug/pretrained-convolutional-neural-networks.html) (for instance: Alexnet) to retrain for a new scenario in dysarthric peech recognition, dysarthric speaker identification and speech intelligibility assessment. 
in this repository we use Gammatonegram as new representation method for speech signal as a picture.
